          I'm a software engineer with a passion for building sleek,
          user-friendly web experiences. I work across both front-end and
          back-end technologies, which helps me create well-rounded solutions
          that look great and work smoothly. I'm always learning and looking for
          ways to improve.
        </p>

          I'm also fascinated by cybersecurity and networking, and I enjoy
          exploring how they can make websites more secure and efficient.
          Whether it's fine-tuning performance or diving into new security
          practices, I'm eager to take on challenges that help me grow as a
          developer.
